shoot rocks and bats in space to increase your score, but be careful.
get hit 3 times and your run is over.

--changes from base file
You can shoot with left mouse button as well as space.
Enemys instead of following you move in a straight line in a random direction and spawn more often.
Added animatded bat with a 1/3 chance of spawning instead of a Rock, has smaller hitbox but moves slower
made it so the game ends once you reach 250 points, (each kill gets you 10 points).
